# Car Garage Project

## Overview

This project is a 3D interactive car garage built using Three.js, which allows users to explore and interact with a car garage environment. The controls enable the user to move around the scene, and the 3D models are stored in the `scene.gltf` file.

You can view the live demo here: [Car Garage Project on Vercel](https://sds-auto-works-sujithravichandran27gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/)
